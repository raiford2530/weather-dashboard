# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is an app that allows users to search by city or by city and country code for its current weather conditions and five day forecast. The current weather conditions returned from the search are temperature, humidity, windspeed, and the UV Index. The five day forecast includes the temperature and humidity. Both also include icons representing the weather. When a user searches for a city, a history button is added for each search so that the user may quickly access the weather for that city from the click of a button. The technologies used to create this project were JQuery, HTML, and CSS. The weather conditions are retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API.
